THE calculator :

Build a simple program in Bash Scripting that can serve as a
calculator.
The program should work with a textual UI
The program will start with a menu:
    a. Add
    b. Subtract
    c. Multiply
    d. Divide
    e. Power of
    f. Modulos
    g. Exit
After choosing a correct option in the menu (validate !)
    a. An input prompt will ask for operation args.
       attention - you need to validate the correctness of
       the args (positive or negative integers) and verify
       the number of the args according to the operator.
    b. After input, the calculation should be done.
    c. The answer and some properties should be displayed
       (each property will be displayed in a separate
       line):
        ■ The answer
        ■ Whether the answer a prime number
        ■ Whether the answer odd or even
        ■ Whether the answer is divided by five without
    a remainder.
    d. After displaying answers, the menu should be
       displayed once again - until Exit option is chosen.



Implementation:
    You have to Validate the input (number).
    ● Handle positive and negative symbols (+,-),
    and spaces and any other character.
    ● Implement and use the followıng functions
        - add()
        - subtract()
        - multiply()
        - divide()
        - power of ()
        - modulus % ()
        - is_prime()
        - is_odd_even()
        - is_div_by_five()
    ● Implement as many auxiliary functions as you
    can.(input,input validation, menu Etc. )
    ● You need to follow the rules of modular programming
    (scoping - local/global, function modularity, interfaces
    between functions - args/returned value Etc.)
